# AMDRadeonSoftwareFIX_AR
Fixes broken AMD Radeon Software (formerly Catalyst) from autorunning at user logon,
also runs the .exe as an ADMIN so that you can finally record and use overlay over
games/apps that are elevated. (idk why is this not regular behaviour tbh)

## How to run?
Right Click -> Run with PowerShell.
That's it.

> _if you changed AMD installation path, edit the script_.


AMD PLEASE FIX
